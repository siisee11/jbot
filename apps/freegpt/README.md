## Accessing Our Hosted API

Utilize our pre-hosted ChatGPT-like API for free by:

1. Joining our [Discord server](https://discord.pawan.krd).
2. Obtaining an API key from the `#Bot` channel with the `/key` command.
3. Incorporating the API key into your requests to:
   ```
   https://api.pawan.krd/v1/chat/completions
   ```

## Usage Examples

Leverage the same integration code as OpenAI's official libraries by simply adjusting the API key and base URL in your requests. For self-hosted setups, ensure to switch the base URL to your local server's address as mentioned above.

### Example Usage with OpenAI Libraries

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'anything'
openai.base_url = "http://localhost:3040/v1/"

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I list all files in a directory using Python?"},
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### Node.js Example

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "anything",
  baseURL: "http://localhost:3040/v1",
});

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
